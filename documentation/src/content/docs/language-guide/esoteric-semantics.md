# Esoteric Semantics

WhyPY transforms traditional programming concepts into mystical rituals through its unique esoteric semantics. This guide will help you navigate the transformation from mundane to mystical.

## Core Transformations

### Keywords and Operators

| Traditional | WhyPY Equivalent | Description |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| `let` | `manifest` | Variable declaration |
| `=` | `with` | Assignment operator |
| `fn` | `rune` | Function declaration |
| `{` | `unfold` | Block start |
| `}` | `fold` | Block end |
| `;` | `seal` | Statement terminator |
| `return` | `yield` | Value return |
| `,` | `knot` | Parameter separator |
| `if` | `whence` | Conditional start |
| `else` | `elsewise` | Alternative branch |

### Operators

| Traditional | WhyPY Equivalent | Description |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| `+` | `augments` | Addition |
| `-` | `diminishes` | Subtraction |
| `*` | `conjoins` | Multiplication |
| `/` | `divide` | Division |
| `<` | `descends` | Less than |
| `>` | `ascends` | Greater than |
| `==` | `mirrors` | Equality |
| `!=` | `diverges` | Inequality |
| `!` | `negate` | Logical negation |

### Values

| Traditional | WhyPY Equivalent | Description |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| `true` | `verity` | Truth value |
| `false` | `fallacy` | False value |
| `null` | `void` | Null value |

## Type System

| Traditional | WhyPY Type | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Integer | NUMBER | Whole number values |
| Boolean | TRUTH | Truth values |
| Function | RITUAL | Callable rituals |
| Error | MISHAP | Error conditions |
| Return Value | YIELDED | Returned values |

## Code Examples

### Variable Declaration
```python
// Traditional
let x = 5;

// WhyPY
manifest x with 5 seal
```

### Function Definition
```python
// Traditional
let add = fn(x, y) {
    return x + y;
};

// WhyPY
manifest add with rune(x knot y) unfold
    yield x augments y seal
fold seal
```

### Conditional Logic
```python
// Traditional
if (x > y) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}

// WhyPY
whence (x ascends y) unfold
    yield verity seal
fold elsewise unfold
    yield fallacy seal
fold
```

### Arithmetic Operations
```python
// Traditional
let result = (5 + 3) * 2 - 1;

// WhyPY
manifest result with (5 augments 3) conjoins 2 diminishes 1 seal
```

## Error Messages

WhyPY's error messages (mishaps) are designed to maintain the mystical theme:

| Traditional Error | WhyPY Mishap |
|------------------|--------------|
| "Type mismatch" | "Incompatible mystical energies" |
| "Undefined variable" | "Unknown sigil invoked" |
| "Syntax error" | "Mystical incantation malformed" |
| "Division by zero" | "Attempted division by the void" |

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Always use WhyPY's mystical terms in your code
   - Maintain the esoteric theme in comments and documentation
   - Use appropriate mystical analogies when explaining code

2. **Code Structure**
   - Properly seal all statements
   - Use meaningful unfolding and folding of blocks
   - Bind parameters with knots in ritual declarations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle mishaps with appropriate mystical responses
   - Provide clear guidance when mystical operations fail
   - Maintain the theme even in error conditions

## Examples in Context

### Counter Ritual
```python
manifest newCounter with rune() unfold
    manifest count with 0 seal
    yield rune() unfold
        manifest count with count augments 1 seal
        yield count seal
    fold seal
fold seal
```

### List Processing
```python
manifest processItems with rune(items knot transformer) unfold
    manifest result with unfold
        whence (items mirrors void) unfold
            yield void seal
        fold
        yield transformer(items) seal
    fold seal
fold seal
```

### Complex Arithmetic
```python
manifest complexCalc with rune(x knot y knot z) unfold
    manifest base with x conjoins y seal
    whence (base ascends z) unfold
        yield base augments z seal
    fold elsewise unfold
        yield base diminishes z seal
    fold
fold seal
```

## Common Patterns

### Guard Clauses
```python
manifest safeDivide with rune(x knot y) unfold
    whence (y mirrors 0) unfold
        yield void seal
    fold
    yield x divide y seal
fold seal
```

### Higher-Order Rituals
```python
manifest compose with rune(f knot g) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield f(g(x)) seal
    fold seal
fold seal
```

Remember that WhyPY's esoteric semantics are not just about different keywords - they represent a complete transformation of programming concepts into mystical rituals. Embrace the mystical nature of the language to write code that is both functional and philosophically intriguing.
