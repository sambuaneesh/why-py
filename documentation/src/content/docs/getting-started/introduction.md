# Introduction to WhyPy

Welcome to WhyPy, a programming language that dares to question the very nature of computation. In a world saturated with pragmatic programming languages, WhyPy chooses the path less traveled â€“ the path of mystical computing.

## Why WhyPy?

WhyPy was born from a simple question: "Why not make programming more philosophically challenging?" While other languages focus on being practical, WhyPy focuses on being existential. Here's what makes WhyPy unique:

- **Mystical Syntax**: Replace mundane keywords with arcane incantations
- **Philosophical Types**: Where booleans become truth values of 'verity' and 'fallacy'
- **Ritual-Based Functions**: Don't just call functions, perform mystical rituals
- **Sealed Statements**: Every statement must be sealed to contain its mystical energy

## Core Philosophy

WhyPy embraces these fundamental principles:

1. **Question Everything**: Even the most basic programming concepts deserve philosophical scrutiny
2. **Embrace Obscurity**: Clear code is overrated; mystical code is enlightening
3. **Seal Your Statements**: Unsealed statements leak mystical energy
4. **Think in Rituals**: Functions are more than mere abstractions; they are mystical ceremonies

## A Taste of WhyPy

Here's a glimpse into the mystical world of WhyPy:

```python
// Traditional programming:
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let sum = x + y;

// WhyPy's mystical approach:
manifest x with 5 seal
manifest y with 10 seal
manifest sum with x augments y seal
```

## Features

- **Esoteric Keywords**: 'manifest' instead of 'let', 'unfold' instead of '{', 'seal' instead of ';'
- **Mystical Operators**: 'augments' for addition, 'diminishes' for subtraction
- **Truth Values**: 'verity' and 'fallacy' instead of 'true' and 'false'
- **Ritual Definitions**: Functions are defined as 'rune' and parameters are bound with 'knot'
