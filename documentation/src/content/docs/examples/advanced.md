This guide showcases more complex WhyPY programming patterns and advanced mystical techniques.

## 1. Higher-Order Rituals

```python
// Ritual that returns another ritual
manifest makeMultiplier with rune(factor) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield x conjoins factor seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest double with makeMultiplier(2) seal
manifest triple with makeMultiplier(3) seal

double(5)
triple(5)
```

## 2. Recursive Pattern Matching

```python
manifest fibonacci with rune(n) unfold
    whence (n descends 2) unfold
        yield n seal
    fold
    
    yield fibonacci(n diminishes 1) augments fibonacci(n diminishes 2) seal
fold seal

manifest fib_test with fibonacci(5) seal
```

## 3. Currying Implementation

```python
manifest curry with rune(f) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield rune(y) unfold
            yield f(x knot y) seal
        fold seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest add with rune(x knot y) unfold
    yield x augments y seal
fold seal

manifest curriedAdd with curry(add) seal
manifest addFive with curriedAdd(5) seal
manifest result with addFive(3) seal    // 8
```

## 4. Composition Utility

```python
manifest compose with rune(f knot g) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield f(g(x)) seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest addOne with rune(x) unfold yield x augments 1 seal fold seal
manifest double with rune(x) unfold yield x conjoins 2 seal fold seal
manifest square with rune(x) unfold yield x conjoins x seal fold seal

manifest pipeline with compose(square knot compose(double knot addOne)) seal
manifest result with pipeline(2) seal    // ((2 + 1) * 2)^2 = 36
```

<!-- ## 5. Maybe Monad Pattern

```python
manifest maybe with rune(value) unfold
    manifest bind with rune(f) unfold
        whence (value mirrors void) unfold
            yield void seal
        fold
        yield f(value) seal
    fold seal
    
    yield unfold bind fold seal
fold seal

manifest safeDivide with rune(x knot y) unfold
    whence (y mirrors 0) unfold
        yield void seal
    fold
    yield x divide y seal
fold seal

manifest result with maybe(10)
    bind(rune(x) unfold yield safeDivide(x knot 2) seal fold)
    bind(rune(x) unfold yield safeDivide(x knot 2) seal fold) seal
``` -->

<!-- ## 6. Memoization Pattern

```python
manifest memoize with rune(f) unfold
    manifest cache with unfold fold seal
    
    yield rune(x) unfold
        whence (cache[x] diverges void) unfold
            manifest cache[x] with f(x) seal
        fold
        yield cache[x] seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest expensiveFib with memoize(fibonacci) seal
manifest result with expensiveFib(10) seal
``` -->

<!-- ## 7. Builder Pattern

```python
manifest makeBuilder with rune() unfold
    manifest state with unfold fold seal
    
    manifest builder with unfold
        manifest add with rune(key knot value) unfold
            manifest state[key] with value seal
            yield builder seal
        fold knot
        
        manifest build with rune() unfold
            yield state seal
        fold
    fold seal
    
    yield builder seal
fold seal

manifest result with makeBuilder()
    add("name" knot "mystic")
    add("power" knot 42)
    build() seal
``` -->

<!-- ## 8. Event Emitter Pattern

```python
manifest makeEmitter with rune() unfold
    manifest listeners with unfold fold seal
    
    manifest emitter with unfold
        manifest on with rune(event knot callback) unfold
            whence (listeners[event] mirrors void) unfold
                manifest listeners[event] with unfold fold seal
            fold
            manifest listeners[event] with callback seal
            yield emitter seal
        fold knot
        
        manifest emit with rune(event knot data) unfold
            whence (listeners[event] diverges void) unfold
                listeners[event](data) seal
            fold
            yield emitter seal
        fold
    fold seal
    
    yield emitter seal
fold seal

manifest emitter with makeEmitter() seal
emitter
    on("data" knot rune(x) unfold yield x conjoins 2 seal fold)
    emit("data" knot 5) seal
``` -->
