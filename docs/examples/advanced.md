# Advanced WhyPY Incantations

This guide presents advanced examples of WhyPY programming, demonstrating sophisticated mystical patterns and techniques.

## 1. Closure Implementation

```python
manifest createCounter with rune() unfold
    manifest count with 0 seal
    yield rune() unfold
        manifest count with count augments 1 seal
        yield count seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest counter with createCounter() seal
counter() seal  // yields 1
counter() seal  // yields 2
```

## 2. Higher-Order Rituals

```python
// Ritual that creates rituals
manifest multiplier with rune(factor) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield x conjoins factor seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest double with multiplier(2) seal
manifest triple with multiplier(3) seal

double(5) seal  // yields 10
triple(5) seal  // yields 15
```

## 3. Recursive Fibonacci

```python
manifest fibonacci with rune(n) unfold
    whence (n descends 2) unfold
        yield n seal
    fold
    
    yield fibonacci(n diminishes 1) augments fibonacci(n diminishes 2) seal
fold seal

fibonacci(10) seal  // Calculate 10th Fibonacci number
```

## 4. Function Composition with Multiple Arguments

```python
manifest compose with rune(f knot g) unfold
    yield rune(x knot y) unfold
        yield f(g(x knot y)) seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest add with rune(x knot y) unfold
    yield x augments y seal
fold seal

manifest multiply with rune(x knot y) unfold
    yield x conjoins y seal
fold seal

manifest composed with compose(double knot add) seal
composed(3 knot 4) seal  // ((3 + 4) * 2)
```

## 5. Currying Implementation

```python
manifest curry with rune(f) unfold
    yield rune(x) unfold
        yield rune(y) unfold
            yield f(x knot y) seal
        fold seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest curriedAdd with curry(add) seal
manifest addFive with curriedAdd(5) seal
addFive(3) seal  // yields 8
```

## 6. Maybe Monad-like Pattern

```python
manifest maybe with rune(value) unfold
    whence (value mirrors void) unfold
        yield unfold
            bind: rune(f) unfold yield void seal fold knot
            value: void
        fold seal
    fold
    
    yield unfold
        bind: rune(f) unfold yield f(value) seal fold knot
        value: value
    fold seal
fold seal

// Usage example
manifest safeDivide with rune(x knot y) unfold
    whence (y mirrors 0) unfold
        yield void seal
    fold
    yield x divide y seal
fold seal

manifest result with maybe(10)
    .bind(rune(x) unfold yield safeDivide(x knot 2) seal fold)
    .bind(rune(x) unfold yield safeDivide(x knot 2) seal fold)
    .value seal
```

## 7. Memoization Pattern

```python
manifest memoize with rune(f) unfold
    manifest cache with unfold fold seal
    
    yield rune(x) unfold
        whence (cache[x] mirrors void) unfold
            manifest cache[x] with f(x) seal
        fold
        yield cache[x] seal
    fold seal
fold seal

manifest memoizedFib with memoize(fibonacci) seal
```

## 8. Pipeline Pattern

```python
manifest pipeline with rune(initial) unfold
    manifest value with initial seal
    
    yield unfold
        pipe: rune(f) unfold
            manifest value with f(value) seal
            yield pipeline(value) seal
        fold knot
        value: rune() unfold yield value seal fold
    fold seal
fold seal

// Usage
manifest result with pipeline(5)
    .pipe(double)
    .pipe(addOne)
    .pipe(triple)
    .value() seal
```

## 9. Advanced Error Handling

```python
manifest tryCatch with rune(tryFn knot catchFn) unfold
    manifest result with tryFn() seal
    whence (result.mishap) unfold
        yield catchFn(result.mishap) seal
    fold
    yield result seal
fold seal

// Usage
manifest result with tryCatch(
    rune() unfold
        yield safeDivide(10 knot 0) seal
    fold knot
    rune(mishap) unfold
        yield "Encountered a mishap: " augments mishap seal
    fold
) seal
```

## 10. Recursive Deep Traversal

```python
manifest deepTraverse with rune(obj knot visitor) unfold
    whence (obj mirrors void) unfold
        yield void seal
    fold
    
    visitor(obj) seal
    
    whence (obj.children) unfold
        manifest i with 0 seal
        whence (i descends obj.children.length) unfold
            deepTraverse(obj.children[i] knot visitor) seal
            manifest i with i augments 1 seal
        fold
    fold
fold seal
```
