# WhyPY

*In a universe of infinite programming languages, we dared to ask... Why not one more?*

## Why WhyPY? Why Not?

In the grand tradition of asking existential questions that nobody needed answers to, we present WhyPY - a programming language that questions its own existence. When Python feels too pythonic and Brainfuck too mainstream, WhyPY offers a mystical journey into the realm of computation.

Is it:
- A programming language? Perhaps.
- An existential crisis? Definitely.
- A way to make simple things unnecessarily mystical? Absolutely!

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository of mystical knowledge
git clone https://github.com/stealthspectre/custom-interpreter.git

# Enter the sacred chamber
cd custom-interpreter

# Prepare your environment for mystical experiences
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or appropriate activation spell for your shell

# Install the required artifacts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple ritual to get you started:

```python
manifest greeting with "Greetings, seeker of truth" seal

manifest sayHello with rune(name) unfold
    manifest message with greeting augments name seal
    yield message seal
fold seal

sayHello("mystic one") seal
```

## The Mystical Theme

WhyPY reimagines programming as a series of mystical rituals. Traditional programming concepts are transformed into arcane ceremonies:

- Variables become "manifestations"
- Functions become "rituals"
- Parameters are bound by "knots"
- Code blocks "unfold" and "fold"
- Statements are sealed with mystical energy
- Errors are "mishaps" in the cosmic flow

For a complete guide to our esoteric semantics, see [docs/semantics.md](docs/semantics.md).

## Features

- Tree-walking interpreter with mystical flair
- First-class rituals (functions)
- Proper closure support
- Vaughan Pratt parsing for elegant expression handling
- Comprehensive mishap (error) handling
- Dynamic typing with a mystical twist

## Implementation

WhyPY is implemented in Python, chosen for its:
- Automatic memory management (because managing memory manually would disturb our chakras)
- Rich standard library (more time for meditation, less for reinventing wheels)
- Accessibility for collaboration (we considered Lisp but didn't want to curse our collaborators)

For implementation details, see [docs/implementation.md](docs/implementation.md).
